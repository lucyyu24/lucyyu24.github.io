Music was my first love. I started playing the piano at the age of four and have always enjoyed performing in public.

In May 2021 I moved to Hawaii and was gifted a ukulele shortly after. I began my songwriting journey then as a way to discover my singing voice and create something from my heart. The result of this chapter was two acoustic EPs: [Chartreuse Phoenix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wujVZ0ioUfk&list=PLRYEGrtWppP0K7eSJnR6jxbYrrjNr9gy7), and [White Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFGzGdKwGzk&list=PLRYEGrtWppP1TiBPlpf0N3iC6yfjl3FtD).
