Growing up I've always loved playing music but thought it wasn't possible for me to write my own. For years I felt a nagging desire to share my voice with the world but kept talking myself out of it.

During the pandemic I thought "fuck it" and started making electronic music in my tiny San Francisco apartment. It felt very difficult at the beginning because of how much I resisted my natural expression. I managed to finish my first track, a dance-y electronic piece [I am a strange loop](https://soundcloud.com/zannyxy/i-am-a-strange-loop-draft?si=b940c3cfd3e74ffda4c4ef133baab604&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing).

In May 2021 I moved to Hawaii and was gifted a ukulele shortly after. I began my songwriting journey then as a way to discover my singing voice and create something from my heart. The result of this chapter was two acoustic EPs: [Chartreuse Phoenix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wujVZ0ioUfk&list=PLRYEGrtWppP0K7eSJnR6jxbYrrjNr9gy7), and [White Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFGzGdKwGzk&list=PLRYEGrtWppP1TiBPlpf0N3iC6yfjl3FtD).

Now I'm at the dovetail of these two journeys: combining elements of singer-songwriter and electronic music to create my own sound.
