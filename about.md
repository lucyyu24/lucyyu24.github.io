Who am I??

![ouroboros](/images/ouroboros.jpg){: .center-image }

1. A living, breathing constellation that evolves and persists. A self-reconfiguring pattern. An ouroboros feasting on the vestige of past selves.

2. Personality structure: enneagram 7. In search of boundless freedom. Debilitated by claustrophobia and an inner restlessness searching for something that *ought to be more than this.*

3. A messy, rawness that wants to be seen -- to express itself by exploding in full ecstasy and color, peering through a cool exterior that edits, fears, and chastises.

4. An alien -- in the world but not of the world -- on the journey home.
