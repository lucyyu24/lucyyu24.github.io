Hi there, you've landed on my blog, a space I intend to use for relaying whatever seems to be in my head these days. You can find a full list of blog posts in the [Archive](/blog/archive), or find me on [Github](https://github.com/lucyyu24), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/lucy_yu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyjyu), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_LucyYu). 

This blog was built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator in Ruby. Shout-outs to [Socicon](http://socicon.com/) for the social media icons and [Glamor](https://www.behance.net/gallery/11786021/Glamor-Chic-Modern-Free-Type-Family) for the title font type.
