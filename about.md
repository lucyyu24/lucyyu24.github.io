Growing up I was told that being an artist is impractical and discouraged from pursuing it as a career.

I spent the first chapter of my life getting a Computer Science degree and pursuing a career in tech, all the while yearning to express the vibrancy I feel within my soul.

It took me a while to see that both my parents are incredibly creative people who did not have the resources or opportunity to share their gifts and my precise reason for being here is to rewrite the story of my family.

Now I’m on a journey of honoring my gifts and sharing them with you. I hope to inspire you to unfold yours

and live out the brilliance within your destiny.
