In elementary school there was a coloring contest for an image with a house and a lawn and sky with clouds above.

I colored the sky blue, the roof of the house red and the lawn green because those are the colors that felt appropriate to me.

When I took my entry to school the next day, I was amazed at what I saw: houses with zebra patterns on the walls, polka-dotted psychedelic looking lawns, skies colored purple and pink and every color of the rainbow.

I looked at my own drawing and felt ashamed. From that moment on I declared myself un-creative.

The other day I stumbled across a video of myself working on a chalkboard mural of a whale with another student in high school.

My jaws dropped because I have no memory of ever doing this. It’s as if a part of me actively rejected this memory.

As I started to jog my memory, I realized my younger self had some train of thought that went like: “well, it’s just a picture of a whale that I rendered onto a chalkboard, it’s not a new idea and it wasn’t even my idea — the other guy wanted to do it so I’m just not even gonna remember this cool thing I did because it’s not worth remembering.”

(here's the video)

Last night I told one of my friends that sometimes I still don’t feel like I’m a creative person. She said *what the fuck*.

There are times when what I’m doing feels so obvious to myself that I fail to see how it could be amazing.

“Oh that old thing? It’s nothing.”

Derek Sivers has this great blog post called [Obvious to you. Amazing to others.](https://sive.rs/obvious) and I’m just reminded of it now.

I should read it again.

I hope you get a kick out of my story. And I hope it inspires you to look at yourself in the mirror, honestly recognizing your own amazingness, no matter how obvious it is.

Happy Valentine’s Day.
