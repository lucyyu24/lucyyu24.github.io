This Christmas I’m giving myself the gift of releasing my first EP. I just submitted it for review and if all goes well it will be live on December 31st.

At the start of this year I made a promise to myself that I would release an album or EP to Spotify by the end of 2022, today I’m fulfilling that promise.

It’s been a winding journey since the inception of my first song when I moved to Maui ~1.5 years ago. The only thing I’ve made musically before then was a lil house track during the pandemic and immediately after I wanted to write a song where I sing and one that comes from my heart.

Since then I’ve been hired by my friend Prince where I’ve played my songs professionally (holy fuck!) and also in more intimate settings. I’ve had friends cry and strangers come up to me telling me I’ve inspired something in them — all of this made me realize how important it is to share my gifts with the world.

With this release I’m bringing closure to a chapter of my life and an old identity — saying goodbye to a heartbreak, to Lucy and to the part of me that’s too self-critical to release anything.

Nothing is ever perfect and there’s so many things I could be doing better with these tracks, yet it is also the most intimate, raw, and real rendering of where I’ve been.

I'll send out another post with the link when it comes out -- I hope you enjoy it.
