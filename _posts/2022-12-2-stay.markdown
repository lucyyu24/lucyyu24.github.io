I’m done being

the fair weather friend

always escaping

by making plans

to a “better” place

my heart demands

an insatiable list

of never ending commands

maybe Bali would soothe my soul

maybe Berlin would be where I land

and finally find peace in the unfolding moment

and not jump to a future expand.


<br />

Maybe I’m scared to be let down

maybe I’m scared nothing makes sense

maybe being on the go

gave me comfort in the shifting sands

even though I long to stay

even though I want to cancel my plans

maybe I just needed a reason

and maybe that reason is…


<br />

Being kind

to myself and the world around me

slowing down to hear the whispers of my heart

even when confusion surrounds me

and not needing to resolve the tension

by finding an immediate next action

but by being

and falling in love

with the question.
