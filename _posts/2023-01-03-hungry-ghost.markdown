This is the story behind track 2 of [Chartreuse Phoenix](https://zanny.net/blog/2022/12/31/chartreuse-phoenix.html), it's called Hungry Ghost. You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/6qtVzRBq76sTO3xcZjQumg?si=6f5daa00d4f24126) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/hungry-ghost/1661683512?i=1661683515).

In November of 2021 I spent a month living alone in LA.

It was a strange time -- I had just left my job and contracted a nagging cough after a trip to Mexico. I also didn't have a car so I spent most of that time in solitude.

My intention for the month was to undo myself from the grind I had been in my whole life. My strategy was simple: to act only when I feel a deep 'yes' in my body, and to do nothing otherwise.

By following this strategy my days started blurring into each other and became one big meditation -- moments of illuminating clarity interspersed with fear, anxiety, criticism and self-judgment:

"What the fuck am I doing? ... What am I supposed to work on? ... I need to see progress, why am I not seeing progress? ... I need to be working on something, I need to see myself working on something."

I remember going for long walks along this river in Frogtown with nothing but these questions burning a hole through my chest. With no one around to distract me these questions hammered at me day and night, ruthlessly.

After a really gueling walk one night I just started humming to myself and the tune for this song came out, with the words: "you're a hungry ghost."

<br />

You’re a hungry ghost

running without heed

struggling to satiate the emptiness within.

<br />

You’re hungry ghost

blinded by your greed

in the name of truth you blur my vision you swallow me.

<br />

When you surrender

your will to the divine

you trade your hunger for a new life.

<br />

Surrender

to the divine

for a new life.

<br />

You’re a hungry ghost

coming out to feed

struggling to satiate the emptiness within.

<br />

You’re hungry ghost

a pity you can’t see

the beauty in the everything that’s right in front of me.

<br />

You’re a hungry ghost

still a part of me

so fan the flames that immolate my restless heart to peace.
