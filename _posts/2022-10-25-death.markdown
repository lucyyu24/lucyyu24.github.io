I’ve been feeling a lot into death lately, as I reflect on my year of death to an old identity.

I never understood why some would get angry at their loved ones for passing. This was the first year I came to understand.

At the passing of an old self when I changed my name in July, I went into grief and for weeks became unable to speak. Emerging from the process I found a friend angry at me.

He was angry that I had “abandoned” him in much of the same way the dead “abandons” the living. In an instant I saw his anger as undigested grief.

In the same way unhealed wounds turn into scars, sadness unfelt becomes encrusted by anger. Yet it is not the role of the dead to comfort the living.

The root of abandonment trauma is the heartbreak of something leaving — more often than not, it’s the leaving of an ideal image: a parent that was supposed to be there for you, a lover promised forever.

Yet having my heartbroken is a gift. It’s the invitation to the journey of a lifetime — to let go of what could be so that I may receive what is:

a greater vision of love.
