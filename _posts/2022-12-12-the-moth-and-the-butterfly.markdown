A while back my brother Anjan showed me this tweet that put to words a certain dynamic I've been wrestling with my whole life. The tweet references [this manifesto](https://mothfund.substack.com/p/moth-fund-manifesto) written by Molly Mielke at the Moth Fund:

The idea is simple -- there are two types of people in the world: those who are moths and those who are butterflies -- the distinction lies in the game they play.

Butterflies are oriented towards **ambition**: they play within traditional systems and seek to gain recognition in established games created by others. Moths, on the other hand, are oriented towards **agency**: playing games of their own creation driven by some mysterious intrinsic force.

For as long as I've been alive I've always been aware of being a butterfly.

As a kid I was aggressively type A with a deep drive to win at any game that was put in front of me.

Growing up in China, my competitiveness and need for external validation aligned with the school system there -- I was consistently top of my class in every subject and surpassed older peers in extracurriculars.

Around the time I became a teenager I grew secretly ashamed of my butterfly-ness.

It occurred to me that I got so accustomed to playing socialized games that I didn't have a thesis for how I really wanted to live my life.

This was my Holden Caulfield era: I saw myself as phony, pretending, manipulative -- hopelessly good at reading the room, gaming the system and lacking in what I felt was a deeper sense of purpose and authenticity.

It was then that I stopped trusting myself and my sense of integrity: "how can I stay true when I'm always caring about what other people think?"

It somehow felt impure to be seeking attention from others.

So then I became a moth-admiring butterfly.

With the same ferocity that drove me towards achievement I became hopelessly attracted to the the strange, esoteric and unusual like moth to a flame.

I was intrigued by anyone and anything that was a world all on their own, seemingly impervious to social pressures or consensus based reality.

A lot of good came out of this era of my life. Just like a lot of good came out of the era prior.

Before psychedelic therapy gained wide acceptance I was "one of those nut jobs that did acid" and it put me on a path towards recovering from depression.

But then there were also some silly things.

I was so embarrassed about participating in any obvious butterfly-ness that I refused to listen to pop music.

I probably missed out on some good music.

My favorite times in childhood were spent working on art projects in my grandparents's home: origami, contraptions made from cardboard boxes, zines.

The best part was always showing my grandparents what I made when they wake up from their daily nap, because of the pure joy it would bring to their faces.

It's memories like these that remind me I've always been a butterfly no matter how mothy I try to be.

I thrive on the appreciation of others -- why reject a fundamental and beautiful part of my being?

We need moths, and we need butterflies.
