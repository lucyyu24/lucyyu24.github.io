There's no such thing as perfection, only balance.

Can I trust that if I lean too far you'll push back?

This balancing act between spontaneoity and thoughtfulness,

self and other.

I changed the name of my blog post yesterday from "Spiritual Obesity" to "Spiritual Over-Consumption" ---

a more precise way of saying the same thing.

I can't always avoid trouble,

people think what they want to think.

But if I can make a change that's both a better articulation of my message and how it will be received by others --- why not?

Win-win.
