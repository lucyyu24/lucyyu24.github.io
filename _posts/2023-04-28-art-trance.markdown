>A painting I worked on last month and the words it came with. Wasn’t ready to share until now.

>This piece is significant to me in more ways than one. It marks the first time I’ve used art to alchemize my decade long struggle with OCD, and the beginning of an understanding that art doesn’t need to be technically complex to be significant.

>This piece is so simple that I could have rendered it in MS paint in a fraction of the time but that would have taken away the healing and insights I received during the meditative process of its painting.

Last week I was in a bad place

and planned to paint a portrait of a butterfly.

What I ended up doing was watching all of the Lord of the Rings

and banging my fingers against the keyboard

seeking relief from my trauma patterns.

<br />

I was reading the description of a textile workshop about

a community in Guerrero

dealing with the trauma of femicide by weaving.

There’s something about

playing Tetris after a traumatic event

it re-patterns your neural pathways and

help lessen the impact of the traumatic memory.

<br />

Importance of art that is trance-inducing to make,

that gives a feeling of satisfaction

as a therapeutic medium.

For a long time I judged the works

of Yayoi Kusama

not understanding the hype for

the lady painting a bunch of dots

on large canvases and pumpkins

until I worked on this piece

and remembered she has OCD like me

and this was her way of channeling

those repetitive thoughts into

something cheerful.  

<br />

ϟ

<br />

Like healing any addiction

the sustainable cure

is finding a replacement for the behavior.

My OCD emerged from a vacuum of meaning

to rid myself of it I must fill the vacuum

with an equal amount of light.

And yet in the throes of intrusive thoughts hell,

I can do little else than

focus on the small things

one simple action at a time.

<br />

ϟ

<br />

I couldn't paint a portrait of a butterfly

but what I could do

is paint circles

and once those circles dried...

halve them in a different color.

And once those dried too --

more circles in both colors:

half and half each.
