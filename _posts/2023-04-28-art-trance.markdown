<br />

Last week I was in a bad place

and planned to paint a portrait of a butterfly.

What I ended up doing was watching all of the Lord of the Rings

and banging my fingers against the keyboard

seeking relief from my trauma patterns.

<br />

I was reading the description of a textile workshop about

a community in Guerrero

dealing with the trauma of femicide by weaving.

There’s something about

playing Tetris after a traumatic event

it re-patterns your neural pathways and

help lessen the impact of the traumatic memory.

<br />

Importance of art that is trance-inducing to make,

that gives a feeling of satisfaction

as a therapeutic medium.

For a long time I judged the works

of Yayoi Kusama

not understanding the hype for

the lady painting a bunch of dots

on large canvases and pumpkins

until I worked on this piece

and remembered she has OCD like me

and this was her way of channeling

those repetitive thoughts into

something cheerful.  

<br />

<br />

Like healing any addiction

the sustainable cure

is finding a replacement for the behavior.

My OCD emerged from a vacuum of meaning

to rid myself of it I must fill the vacuum

with an equal amount of light.

And yet in the throes of intrusive thoughts hell,

I can do little else than

focus on the small things

one simple action at a time.

<br />

<br />

I couldn't paint a portrait of a butterfly

but what I could do

is paint circles

and once those circles dried...

halve them in a different color.

And once those dried too --

more circles in both colors:

half and half each.
