This is Katya, my family’s doberman puppy.

I’m taking care of her for the time being while my family is away for a two weeks trip.

One of my primary responsibilities is to take her on a walk at 7 am — a task my mom performed without fail every morning but also one she dreaded.

As a curious and strong-willed puppy, it doesn’t take very long for Katya to wander off tugging on her leash, hurling mom along in the process.

To prevent this, mom tugs on the leash and shouts at Katya consistently to keep her at a close distance.

I felt exhausted watching the whole thing and knew this isn’t how it’s supposed to be.

Just the day before we took her out on a long walk with my sister and stepdad and the journey was mostly pain free.

What made the difference?

The leash.

The one used by my mom is fixed length and not very long. The one used by my sister and stepdad is contractable, with greater flexibility and range.

The problem was so obvious to me that I brought it up to mom immediately, to which she replied: “ah, it doesn’t make a difference, it can’t be.”

For the last few days since my family left I’ve been testing out the leashes myself, and the difference is glaringly obvious.

Given a long enough leash Katya has sufficient room to explore and slows down naturally when she’s nearing the limit, I only have to tug a little on the occasion she forgets.

I don’t have to keep Katya close because at the end of the day I know she’s doesn’t want to run away, she just wants to play.

Much of the same can be said about taming ourselves, the wild animal within; and managing our relationships, which is in effect, taming each other.

In a way, the deeper we trust ourselves, each other, the world around us — the longer we’re comfortable making our “leash.”

It is only in extending our leash that more interesting things start to happen — new horizons, deeper discoveries.

Although we don’t always see eye to eye I’m grateful for the type of relationship I can have now with my family.

We don’t feel obligated to see each other and yet I know we’ll be there for one another if there’s ever a great illness or financial injury.

My closest friendships are similar: weeks and months can go by without us talking and we’ll still pick up the phone at midnight if one of us has a bad trip.

My weirdness and creativity can be largely credited to the space I’ve been given by others.

Yet trust is not built overnight, and chaos could ensue from extending our leash too quickly or letting it go completely.

We always think we want unlimited freedom, and yet it is tension that keeps us related to one another, and in integrity.

So for now, we start off with a shorter leash —

pushing and pulling,

towards more harmonious ways to be.
