<br />

Some days

the words flow smoothly and easily --

an inner reality captured by outer expression,

a perfect delivery,

a clear channel of energy.

<br />

Other days

the facuet spits and splatters,

the flow starting and stopping,

the water dark and murky.

<br />

The only way to clear a faucet

is to let the water flow --

don't shut it off

when you're embarrassed

by what's coming out.
