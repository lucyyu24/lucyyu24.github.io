In the space between lives a name emerged:

Danny, only it was 80% correct.

I resisted taking on a name that wasn’t 100% mine.

Yet we never come into this world fully formed.

The journey of imperfection is one of bravery.

The fear is of forgetting who I am, again.

So I was Danny for a day.

And as Danny sat in the glistening afternoon sun in an Oakland backyard,

he picked up a stick and with his hand he traced the ground:

the letter ‘Z’ —

A hell yes.

Z as in the last alphabet.

Z as in Zero. Reset.

Z as in what comes after X and Y, chromosomes.

Is Zanny a name? I wasn’t sure.

But it felt tongue in cheek. Xanny? Not quite.

Walking to Zebra body piercing I decided to make it my name.

And then it became my name.

Walked off the old one.
