It’s 38 minutes past midnight and I’m just sitting down to write today’s post.

An hour ago I started walking upstairs, planned to wind-down and wrap up by reflecting on the emotions I’ve been feeling in the last couple of days.

I had ideas of what I wanted to say.

I wanted to tell the story of how I felt leaving my job last week; I wanted to make an announcement of what I’m up to next.

Instead I found my brother accidentally spilling hot tea on his partner. We spent the next hour pouring cold water on her skin.

I’m writing these words as she’s being tucked in, rocked by slow Kirtan music, unwinding from the intensity.

When I was around 7 I had grand visions of what my life was going to be like. I was going to marry as early as I can and have a kid before I’m 26 so that my grandparents can experience what it’s like to have a great-grand child.

26 came and as far as I’m concerned, there’s no kid coming any time soon.

I remember being unable to understand why depression exists when watching TV dramas with my grandma. It didn’t make sense to me why anyone would not want to live.

Then one day I was 14 and I found myself unable to be happy. For the next decade depression became my default reality.

When I was 19 I wanted to be an entrepreneur in my twenties so I can have fuck-you money in my thirties to travel and make art.

It turns out I don’t need that much money, neither do I want to wait that long.

At the start of this post I did not intend to come out about 3 different things: leaving my job, struggles with depression, intention of becoming an artist.

But alas I did. Not all announcements are made with fanfare — some breeze through like summer winds.

May we love our maps, and may we love our territories.
