Today’s blog post is brought to you by the latest installment in our personal growth journey: Becoming Uncool™.

Becoming Uncool is a multi-year program designed to help you unlearn everything you knew about how to behave in public.

For the low price of facing your fears of being made fun of -- you get access to:
- A full range of emotional expressions
- The ability to say or do whatever you want around people you find attractive
- Living in the moment and actually enjoying yourself

But wait, there’s more!

Pay close attention because if you text your crush back immediately in the next 2 minutes you’ll also get access to our exclusive bonus material: Secure Attachment™.*

*Secure Attachment™ is a free introduction to our advanced level curriculum Healthy Relationships™.

Don't just be cool, be uncool. What are you waiting for -- sign up today!
