Again and again we feel
the sand slip through
our fingers
as we chase
after the ghost of perfections past --
a most exquisite sunrise,
a perfect kiss,
a slow-moving, beautiful moment
shinning like an iridescent pearl
in the terrain of our memory
that we seek to recreate
again and again
like stir crazy gamblers with hunger in our eyes
scanning the horizon
for the
pure
white
dragon.
