My first conscious memory of eating meat came when I was around 4 sitting in my grandparents's TV room.

I asked my grandma what she was feeding me and felt a visceral disgust at the realization I was eating a piece of dead animal.

An intention was seeded in that moment.

The summer I turned 17 I came across [FullyRawKristina](https://www.youtube.com/@FullyRawKristina) on Youtube and became completely absorbed.

This led to one of my manic self-improvement projects: a raw vegan cleanse.

I went from pretty much not knowing how to cook to going to the farmer's market 3 times a week to buy vegetables using the meager pocket money I had at the time, making a juice for lunch and a salad for dinner:

The diet only lasted for two weeks but it felt like the best damn two weeks of my life.

I had so much energy and experienced such a lightness in my body I haven't felt before.

The seed began to sprout.

But then it laid dormant for many years.

After that summer it became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't keep up the lifestyle, given that I didn't have money for groceries and I was still living with my parents, who discouraged me from making the change out of long-term health concerns.

Then life got busy, I had other things to worry about and forgot about the whole thing.

When I moved to Maui in 2021 I lived next to this lil grocery store called [Farmer's Market Maui](https://www.farmersmarketsmaui.com/). They made such damn good impossible burgers and tofu sandwhiches that it took me about 3 days to notice that I haven't eaten any meat since I landed.

Then one day a few weeks later I was listening to Die Antwoord and stumbled across this video [on them being vegan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8uC0MYBBwY), which led me to watching [The Game Changers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E_K86jtE58) the next day.

The insight that I could be vegan and also healthy long-term catalyzed an internal process and very soon I started telling people that I was pescatarian.

I didn't want to give up fish but oh baby have we crossed over some threshold and there's no going back.

On the flight from Maui back to San Francisco, with the mental clarity that comes at high altitudes I felt into the experience of eating fish and realized that eventually I won't be able to do that either -- it just feels kinda gross.

Then in January of this year I treated myself to a nice sushi dinner and that was the last time I ate fish.

Nowadays I tell people that I'm vegan -- sometimes I might still eat a little bit of cheese. I'm not so concerned with being 100%, but maybe one day I will be.

Why am I telling you this?

**#1 life is emergent and organic**

Have faith in the process of your own becoming, but also find the right environment to plant your seeds and they will blossom on their own accord.

You get it.

I'm really proud of myself for finally aligning to a diet that feels good for me, but looking back -- it was gonna happen anyways.

<br />

**#2 there's no point fighting over this stuff**

My life has led me to this point due to a series of events which provided information, combined with the intuition I have and the choices I've made accordingly.

I could have started out my life growing up in a vegan family and had an auto-immune disorder that was cured when I ate meat for the first time.

My veganism is not a statement or identity -- it's a choice that makes me feel good.

I can't tell you what feels right for you, but I can share my experience in case it resonates with yours and supports you on your journey.
