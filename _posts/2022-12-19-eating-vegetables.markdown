My first conscious memory of eating meat was when I was around 3 or 4 sitting in my grandparents's TV room.

I asked my grandma what she was feeding me and felt viscerally gross at the realization I was eating a piece of dead animal.

A seed was planted in that moment.

The summer I turned 17 I came across [FullyRawKristina](https://www.youtube.com/@FullyRawKristina) on Youtube and became completely absorbed.

This led to one of my manic self-improvement projects: a raw vegan cleanse.

I went from pretty much not knowing how to cook to going to the farmer's market 3 times a week to buy vegetables using the meager pocket money I had at the time.

I would come back with a bunch of fruits and vegetables and make a juice for lunch and a salad for dinner:

The diet only lasted for two weeks but it felt like the best damn two weeks of my life.

I remember having so much energy and feeling such a lightness in my body that I haven't felt before.

The seed began to sprout.

Then the intention laid dormant for many years.

After that summer it became quickly apparent to me that it would be really difficult to keep being raw vegan, given that I didn't have money for groceries and my family was not vegan.

My parents also actively discouraged me from the lifestyle change because they didn't believe a vegan diet could be nutritionally complete.

Then life got busy, I had other things to worry about and forgot about the whole thing.

When I moved to Maui in 2021 I lived next to this lil grocery store called [Farmer's Market Maui](https://www.farmersmarketsmaui.com/). They made such damn good impossible burgers and tofu sandwhiches that it took me about 3 days to notice that I haven't eaten any meat since I landed.

Then one day a few weeks later when I was listening to Die Antwoord and happened to stumble across this video [on them being vegan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8uC0MYBBwY), which led me to watching [The Game Changers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E_K86jtE58) the next day.

All of these experiences catalyzed an internal process of things slowly coming into alignment and very soon I started telling people that I was pescatarian.

I didn't want to give up fish.

On the flight from Maui back to San Francisco, with the mental clarity given to me at high altitudes I felt into the experience of eating fish and realized that eventually I won't be able to do that either.

Then in January of this year I treated myself to a nice sushi dinner and that was the last time I ate fish.

Nowadays I tell people that I'm vegan -- but sometimes I might still eat a little bit of cheese. I'm not so concerned with being 100%.

What's the point of me telling you this?

Honestly it's 12 am and I'm losing track of the thought train that led me down this ramble. Something something life is emergent and organic, something something have faith in the process of your own becoming, but also find the right environment to plant your seeds and they will blossom.

You get it.
