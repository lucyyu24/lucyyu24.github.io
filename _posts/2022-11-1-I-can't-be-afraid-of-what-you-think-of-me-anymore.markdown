I can’t be afraid of what you think of me anymore:

The truth is I’ve never not been an artist,

every moment of my life, poetry.

But I am always afraid to share my inner reality,

for fear you will project onto it, a distorted image of me.

When I looked like a hot girl you thought I was dumb,

and when you knew I had a computer science degree that somehow changed your mind,

stupid how we think we know everything.

In this reductionist reality where we can’t sidestep every projection shot our way,

like dodging lasers in a Mission Impossible movie,

we can only try our best to say the things, even if they’re said imperfectly.

With trepidation our voice may be influenced by the anxiety we feel,

“hi hello how are you,” feigned niceties.

Even then there’s no shame in being inauthentic,

we’re just trying our best to fit in.

For years I thought I was blocked creatively,

before realizing that it wasn’t the creation I was blocked on,

but the courage to bare my soul to the world.

It takes a brave heart to stand in my truth,

especially when that truth still stands to be corrected.

Now I’m getting closer to my insides being my outsides,

and I’m ready for my reality to be a reflection of me

because I can’t be afraid of what you think of me anymore,

I can’t let this voice die inside of me.
