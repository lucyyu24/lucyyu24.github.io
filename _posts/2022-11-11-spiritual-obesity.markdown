> A word of caution: this post could come across as judgmental towards obesity --- it's not my intention for it to seem that way.

I'm at a multi-day party this weekend and instead of declaring bankruptcy on my daily writing challenge I’m leaning into it.

And it's not because I really want to commit for the sake of committing --- but rather, I feel that there’s a lot of value in being with myself and integrating my experiences.

I feel that people in America really struggle with obesity at multiple levels. Physical obesity is readily observable, spiritual obesity is not.

You can get someone who’s physically slim but stuffing themselves with new experiences without reflecting on them and digesting the lessons therein.

Consequently they end up repeating the same mistakes and live life through a revolving door while never getting to the other side.

I was in that position for a while. It was too painful to reflect on some of my experiences so I just kept having more of them. I also thought the solution to my problems was always outside of me — perhaps just waiting at the next corner.  

It took to hitting rock bottom for me to slow down.

No branches can go to heaven if the roots don’t go to hell.

Because within every moment of sadness, anger, anxiety, grief, lies the fertile soil upon which your future self can grow. And by resisting to tune in, you are depriving yourself of unlocking so much potential.

And within every moment of joy, bliss, celebration is the vital nutrient that sustains you for the road ahead --- the nutrient that helps you digest those more difficult moments.

So why wouldn’t you want to harvest every moment?

Why let it go to waste?
