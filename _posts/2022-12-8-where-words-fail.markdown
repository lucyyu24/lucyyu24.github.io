<br />

I don't feel safe

when I cannot explain myself

this distance between

feels like hell.

<br />

I keep forgetting

it's not the words that tell

but the knowing inside

what we feel in our cells.

<br />

When I awake to my heart

I hope you can as well

so you can meet me

in the place where words fell.
