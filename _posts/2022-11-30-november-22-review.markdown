At the end of last month my friend Joyce asked me to join her [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) group and I almost said no -- NaNoWriMo stands for "National Novel Writing Month" and I had no desire of writing a novel at that time. Eventually she convinced me to see it as an opportunity for creative accountability and that I can make the goal to be whatever I want. So at the last hour I committed to the goal of writing a blog post every day.

My rationale emerged from the insight that I have no trouble being creative -- the part where I get stuck is showing my work to the world. Growing up in hyper-critical environments gave me the habit of picking my work apart before it even sees the light of day -- I wanted to reverse this trend and start showing my work even if I don't think it's good enough.

Fast forward to now, all I want to say is: I can't believe it's the last day of November and I can't believe I finished the challenge!

It makes me so happy to see you guys consistently reading my blog, messaging me about it and bringing it up during our conversations. Taking a moment to celebrate and sharing some messages that felt really awesome to receive:

<br />

Looking at the stats, it's so awesome to see that the average session duration is 2.5 minutes! Since most of my posts are fairly short this means y'all are actually taking the time to read:

The most rewarding part of this month has been the experience of sharing more of myself with you all and feeling held through the process. There were days when I would have some vulnerability hangover after publishing a blog post that felt a little too personal, and then I would get a message from one of you saying that it really resonated -- and it would make the whole thing feel worthwhile.

Even though this is my blog -- you are co-creating it with me with your every feedback and encouragement. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
