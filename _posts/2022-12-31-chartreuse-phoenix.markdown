My EP is out today and I’m really proud of what it took to get here.

One of the hardest things for me to do is accepting a version of myself that feels outdated. I habitually cringe at the things I’ve said or done in the past — because who I was always feels less true than who I am now.

I actually recorded this EP back in September but abandoned it because it no longer represents me — not the album cover or the lyricism or the aesthetic. Since writing this EP I’ve come out about my gender identity, changed my name and pronouns.

In spiritual teachings they say the world is an illusion and the goal of life is getting to truth. While I feel like this is the path I’m on sometimes my quest towards truth becomes the very obstacle towards it -- I'll get so scared of saying something untrue that I end up saying nothing at all.

I no longer want to keep it all in -- there’s beauty in the becoming and not just what’s become, there's wholeness in embracing every part of the journey -- the butterfly and the cocoon it emerged from are not separate from each other.

So here it is: my first EP on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2p9qv4jN1kTiUrUNse9inb?si=KENUTmwoTo-xI4rRUKmHKw) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/chartreuse-phoenix-single/1661683512).
