My EP is out today (!!) and I’m really proud of what it took to get here.

One of the hardest things for me to do is accepting who I was. I habitually cringe at the things I’ve said or done in the past — because who I was always felt less true than who I am now.

This EP was actually recorded in September but half-abandoned out of a feeling that it no longer represents me, not the album cover or the lyricism or the aesthetic: since writing the EP I’ve come out about my gender identity and have long since healed through the heartbreak that inspired it.

In spiritual teachings they say the world is an illusion and the goal of life is arriving at truth. I took this way too seriously and what I'm learning now that my quest towards truth has been the very obstacle blocking it: at times I get so worried about saying something untrue that I end up saying nothing at all.

I no longer want to keep it all in – who I was yesterday is just as true as who I am now, there’s beauty in the becoming and not just what’s become -- the butterfly and the cocoon are not separate from each other.


So here it is: my first EP on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2p9qv4jN1kTiUrUNse9inb?si=KENUTmwoTo-xI4rRUKmHKw) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/chartreuse-phoenix-single/1661683512).
