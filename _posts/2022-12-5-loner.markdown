<br />

I have always wanted

to do everything alone

deeply terrified

to actually make room

for the presence of another

who might knock me off my center

because I can’t help but

put their feelings above my own.

<br />


Maybe it’s a curse

of a boy who feels too much

but maybe it’s a power

misused as a hutch

to cage myself in

from a world so lush

so I can “keep it together”

and not turn into mush.

<br />


"Because how can I trust in

what feels like the mad rush

of chaotic others

untamed by my touch?

Maybe I can stay here

with my things it’s enough

to keep me going

I just need to stay tough."
