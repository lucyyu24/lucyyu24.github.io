[Enneagram 7 growing the fuck up.](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7)

About 10 minutes ago I had a major insight into what's been blocking my creative process.

I realize that I'm always searching for something "better" instead of working with what I have.

I used to be super cynical in school: during group assignments I'll almost always reject ideas suggested by others and think that they're not good enough without looking at them first.

When I don't like something I end up throwing out the whole damn thing -- the baby with the bath water.

Then I'll sit there waiting around for the perfect idea to land in my head and it would never come. And I'll complain about feeling uninspired.

It's like the Eskimo story:

> There was a man who was ice fishing when the patch of ice he was on broke off and he started to drift out to sea. The man could not swim, and he frantically prayed to God to rescue him.  An Eskimo came  by in a boat and offered to take the man to shore. The man refused the Eskimo’s offer saying, “No thanks, God will take care of me.” This happened two more times, and the man turned down the offers of help from the two additional Eskimos with the same answer that God was taking care of him. The person drowned. When the person got to heaven, he angrily asked God why He hadn’t answered his prayer and saved him. God patiently explained, 'My son, I tried to save you three times and each time you refused my help.'

In a way I'm always looking to find and execute on some perfect vision instead of working with the ingredients I already have.

Instead of going to the farmer's market, picking out the freshest produce and figuring out what I can make with them -- I'm conceptualizing some perfect meal in my head with hard to get ingredients and making my life miserable.

Instead of meeting reality where it is, what I'm doing is saying "give me something better."

What I keep forgetting is that the only way out is through, the only way towards something better is working with what I have in front of me.

Drawing from the fertile soil of my lived experiences instead of searching for inspiration around the next corner.
