One of the most powerful discoveries I made in the last year is that Art = Survival.

It's such a big discovery that it's taken me months to say it, because I was so worried about saying it right.

Instead of struggling in vain to articulate how deep this wisdom cuts -- I'm just gonna let this video speak for itself and paste these paragraphs from the video description. Be prepared to have your world rocked, because that's what happened to me:

"The great Swiss psychologist and student and colleague of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, was obsessed with the Australian Aborigine.

Jung also estimated that the Australian Aborigine spent three to four hours a day meeting their survival needs.

But where Jung felt that the Australian Aborigines were unique among the world’s indigenous peoples was how they utilised the overwhelming majority of their time.

According to Jung, they spent that time almost exclusively cultivating a higher state of consciousness.

Or, in Jungian terms: they spent the vast majority of their time contacting and immersing themselves in the collective unconscious.

Now, it is not unusual for the Earth’s indigenous people to endeavour to raise their consciousness or to make contact with so-called spiritual realms.

However, the Australian Aborigines used every spare moment for consciousness-raising. Jung, among others, estimated that they spent ¾ of their lives doing this.

And, like the New Zealand Maori, the Australian Aborigine did not use any psychoactive plants to assist them.
Instead, the way in which they cultivated a higher consciousness was exclusively through the practice of art.

Story, music, song, dance & painting were the methods that Australian Aborigines used.

All of these were practised and performed so that they might more deeply dwell in what they knew as: The Dreaming.


The Dreaming

The Dreaming: The now-moment, beyond the historical, always Now, only apparently Then. The moment before the existence of time when Nothing became Something.
The Australian Aborigine’s Dreaming is primarily a creation myth. And, like ALL creation myths, from the ancient Indian Vedas to the
Judeo-Christian myth of Genesis, it points to that ‘moment’ before Time
where Nothing produced Something.

All culture's creation myths, including the scientiﬁc explanation called “The Big Bang,” point to, or attempt to explain this relation between Nothing & Something."
