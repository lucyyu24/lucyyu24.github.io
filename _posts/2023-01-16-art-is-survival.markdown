One of the most powerful discoveries I made recently is: Art = Survival.

It's such a profound discovery that it's taken me months to talk about it, because I really wanted to give this statement the proper attention it deserves.

For my whole life I've been taught that art is a luxury, not a necessity.

On the maslow's hierarchy, art is something bundled with aesthetic and self-actualization needs that comes way after the satiation of food, water, shelter.

So much high art has also left me questioning the role of art in society.

Some of it feels frivolous, disconnecting, catering to the tastes of the societal elite.

<br />

But what if we have it all wrong?

What if art is necessary for the survival of the human spirit and species? Just as necessary as food, water, and shelter?

What if our problems of war and destruction are problems of creativity?

During a really memorable flight I watched the movie "Where'd You Go, Bernadette."

The story is about a brilliant architect turned neurotic recluse years after leaving the craft.

Mid-movie a line came on and it broke me open:

"People like you must create. That's what you were brought into this world to do, Bernadette. If you don't, you become a menace to society."

I believe we're all here to create, that creation is the essence of life and when we don't create we start destroying ourselves and each other.

<br />

Beyond channeling our energy towards creation rather than destruction, art plays the role of bridging realities.

In this increasingly polarized world, art is needed now more than ever to break us out of the confines of our own minds.

The mind rationalizes, weaving an echo chamber that distances ourselves from those incongruent with our realities.

Art is the anchor that can ground us in our common humanity.

Beyond beliefs and identities we are all creatures, flesh and bone, that speak the language of sensation and feelings.

Art is the articulation of this language.  

<br />

Finally, art inspires us to surmount insanely difficult tasks in the challenges of survival.

If you want concrete evidence, consider this video on the Australian Aborigine living in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet:

Pasted from the video description:

"The great Swiss psychologist and student and colleague of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, was obsessed with the Australian Aborigine.

Jung also estimated that the Australian Aborigine spent three to four hours a day meeting their survival needs.

But where Jung felt that the Australian Aborigines were unique among the world’s indigenous peoples was how they utilised the overwhelming majority of their time.

According to Jung, they spent that time almost exclusively cultivating a higher state of consciousness.

Or, in Jungian terms: they spent the vast majority of their time contacting and immersing themselves in the collective unconscious.

Now, it is not unusual for the Earth’s indigenous people to endeavour to raise their consciousness or to make contact with so-called spiritual realms.

However, the Australian Aborigines used every spare moment for consciousness-raising. Jung, among others, estimated that they spent ¾ of their lives doing this.

And, like the New Zealand Maori, the Australian Aborigine did not use any psychoactive plants to assist them.
Instead, the way in which they cultivated a higher consciousness was exclusively through the practice of art.

Story, music, song, dance & painting were the methods that Australian Aborigines used.

All of these were practised and performed so that they might more deeply dwell in what they knew as: The Dreaming.


The Dreaming

The Dreaming: The now-moment, beyond the historical, always Now, only apparently Then. The moment before the existence of time when Nothing became Something.
The Australian Aborigine’s Dreaming is primarily a creation myth. And, like ALL creation myths, from the ancient Indian Vedas to the
Judeo-Christian myth of Genesis, it points to that ‘moment’ before Time
where Nothing produced Something.

All culture's creation myths, including the scientiﬁc explanation called “The Big Bang,” point to, or attempt to explain this relation between Nothing & Something."

Art heals. Art brings people together. Art brings people back to themselves. Art inspires. Art paints a hopeful vision of the future.

Art is survival.
