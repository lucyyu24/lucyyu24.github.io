This is the story behind track 3 of [Chartreuse Phoenix](https://zanny.net/blog/2022/12/31/chartreuse-phoenix.html), it's called Drive On. You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4XiwkFXDWeJ0mZjwfxvrRI?si=c33bf570b78547f6) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/drive-on/1661683512?i=1661683966).

One of my favorite books of all time is "Bird by Bird" by Anne Lamott. In it she has this quote:

>  E.L. Doctorow said once said that 'Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.' You don't have to see where you're going, you don't have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you. This is right up there with the best advice on writing, or life, I have ever heard.

<br />

Moving to Maui in May 2021 I started receiving visions of myself performing on stage. I have never even written a song before so the idea of being a musician felt really fucking scary.

Soon after I was gifted a ukulele and the first song I learned to play on it was "Dreams" by Fleetwood Mac. I played around with the chords I found online and converged on a pattern of A minor, C, and F. I started playing it for myself almost every day -- whenever I got bored or simply wanted to self soothe.

One day when I was sitting under a full moon I habitually started playing "Dreams" again, and after I finished singing I just kept strumming the same chords. Then I started humming and the first words that came were actually something like "drive on, drive on, baby, drive on."

It felt like I was talking to myself and the melody punched through like the first stream of clear water from a rusty pipe.

<br />

I carried this song with me for well over almost a year before it was finished. The part with "illuminate the fire" actually wasn't written until March 2022.

Over the course of carrying this song I felt so anxious about its incompleteness -- I was experimenting with different chords, trying to find the words and the melody that would complete the song but every time it just felt like a struggle.

I was hungry for completion but it didn't hapeen until I had almost given up on it. Then when it was done and I played it for someone close to me for the first time, I cried.

Drive on, my love, oh drive on.

Drive on, my love, oh drive on.

Let the headlights take you home,

destination unknown,

drive on, my love, oh Drive on.

<br />

You had a fear of the unknown,

so cavalier you never did show.

You were scared of your reflection,

misplaced trust in your perfection.

Drive on, my love, oh Drive on

<br />

Illuminate the fire burning deep within.

Take hold of your desire and slowly reel it in.

Dig deep beneath the trauma, where your heart remains.

Find your way back to your dharma, the truest place you’ve been.

<br />

Drive on, my love, oh drive on.

Drive on, my love, oh drive on.

Let the headlights take you home,

destination unknown,

drive on, my love, oh Drive on.

<br />

The road is winding and the road is long,

sometimes the short cut feels plain wrong.

Turn off the GPS, come on,

follow the rhythm of your heart’s song.

Drive on, my love, oh Drive on.

<br />

Illuminate the fire burning deep within.

Take hold of your desire and slowly reel it in.

Dig deep beneath the trauma, where your heart remains.

Find your way back to your dharma, the place where you began.

<br />

Drive on, my love, oh drive on.

Drive on, my love, oh drive on.

To a place where you belong,

to a place to write this song,

drive on, my love, oh Drive on.
