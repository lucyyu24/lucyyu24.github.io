Is my life a to-do list or a river? 

Maybe that's not the right question. 

Things are rarely either-or,

agonizing mental contraptions. 

<br />

When we say "life is a river!"

we sneer at the to-do list people as we're floating downstream 

in our raft built by unicorn floaties

we dodge to-dos flying our way sending paper cuts

deflating good times.

<br />

When we say "life is a to-do list!"

we look down at the list seeking after the next high

of completing another checkbox --

- [] Cross the river

scorning at the stupid river people with their stupid river floaties

getting in our way.

<br />

But maybe life is a river of to-do lists and 

we can make titianium rafts that won't deflate with the tides

because vehicles that can't survive paper cuts 

are here for a good time not a long time.

<br />

And maybe life can be a to-do list of rivers 

where we raft towards our destination, 

because planning a route where we have to cross rapids 

might be a stupid idea. 

<br />
 
I have a dream.
