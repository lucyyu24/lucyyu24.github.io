<br />

Use fear as your compass

allow it to enliven you

embolden you without consuming you in its flames

fire up your engine, ride on its waves

for your deepest desires never come without the pain

of leaving behind your struggles in vain

to evade your passions, close your heart and remain

at the edge of the world evading your reign --

<br />
so take it by the neck and grab onto its reins

hold onto your fear like a wild beast to tame

find the thrill of the chase let it take you on a fast lane

boldly into the source of your pain

your greatest treasures, your deepest terrain

the place where you have nothing to lose

<br />
and everything to gain.
