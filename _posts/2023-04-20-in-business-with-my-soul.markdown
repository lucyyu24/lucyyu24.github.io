*Me at age 8 pretending to sell something. LOL.*

<br />
I was sitting at the barbershop the other day when I felt a sudden envy towards my barber. Looking at him through the mirror, it struck me that just like myself, he is an artist, and yet we‚Äôre very different.

Compared to him I don‚Äôt have the immediate feedback loop of a business: no real customers to work with on a project to project basis, and no one paying me to write a song or a blog post or paint a painting.

Arguably this is true for even very successful artists ‚Äî unless they‚Äôre commissioned for a project, there‚Äôs no paying customer knocking on the door with specific instructions, requests and deadlines, setting the stage for the next piece and providing immediate feedback.

œü

On the way back from the barbershop, a sudden realization hit me:

I am in business ‚Äî

in business with my soul.

Walking along the highway a wellspring of insights started to bubble up as cars flew by me, and I began to realize the potency of this analogy.

œü

Just like a flesh and bones customer my soul pays for projects and the payment is always immediate: in lesson learned, trauma healed, happiness and bliss.

For longer projects they may even pay me an advance in the form of inspiration or synchronistic moments to keep me going.

And yet, just like any other business mine also attracts scam artists and fake customers: the voices in my head that makes me feel small and constricted, telling me to play it safe rather than explore and expand. I can usually tell they‚Äôre scams because the cheques they give me don‚Äôt cash at the happiness and bliss bank (but it may work at the ego and fear bank ‚Äî unfortunately there‚Äôs no currency exchange).

I've learned to develop a spidey sense for those types overtime.

œü

When you have a customer the way to make your business thrive is to take their every request with respect and seriously. This means writing their requests down, giving them a time estimate of when it will be delivered, and provide consistent updates on your progress.

When business is slow I can afford to be sloppy: pulling all-nighters for those occasional flashes of inspiration my soul sends me, not needing to plan things out or keep a todo list.

When business is demanding I have to get organized, keep track of all my ideas and get better at budgeting my time and resources over the long term. This means learning how to scale back visions, preserving context in-between working sessions, staying consistently motivated and avoiding burnout.

œü

To be honest I‚Äôve been having a bad time lately because I‚Äôm overwhelmed by the requests my soul has been sending me.

Some of them are not well-scoped so I have to first work on figuring out what the constraints are. Others require much more time and skill than I currently possess and the gap feels intimidating.

At this point I‚Äôm realizing that like any other customer I can always communicate with my soul.

By expressing my concerns I‚Äôm often surprised to find easier options or even receiving assistance.

 œü

The customer is always right.

My soul always knows what‚Äôs best for me but it doesn‚Äôt mean I understand them completely.

Sometimes I need to do a little bit of back and forth with them before arriving at exactly what they need.

Other times I take their requests too literally and get stuck unnecessarily.

Like any good relationship it's best not to make assumptions.

I find myself having to ask lots of questions and practise deep listening.

 œü

I know we live in an era now where people are waking up to the follies of capitalism and no longer romanticizing the grind.

And yet ‚Äî I believe some people are born to hustle.

In elementary school my idea of fun was to play pretend making ledgers and invoices for my grandparents.

In middle school I made a cash register out of a cereal box and binder clips.

Last year I saw a miniature McDonald‚Äôs in a toy train set at the Randall Museum, and I was surprised to hear my inner child saying: "One of these lifetimes I wanna be a burger tycoon.‚Äù

A part of me sincerely and innocently loves the idea of businesses. It's a part of the play.

So the question has always been,

what do I play for?

Money, status, french fries?

 œü

Well, from today and every day onwards...

I play for my soul.
