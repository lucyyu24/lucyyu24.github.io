The worst thing about being depressed

is that it makes me hate everyone --

even people who are trying to help.

So I push them all away

and I dig myself into deeper aloneness.

<br />

But maybe there's an intelligence

to being alone during dark times,

and what I'm really doing

is wrapping myself in a cocoon

to make sure I finish

feeling all the feelings.
