I'm worried no matter how much I accomplish

I will always be emotionally stuck in that summer

when the days were long and the nights were lonely

face down on the carpet listening to Private Island

reminiscing about the recent passing

of dreams and visions

belonging to another space and time --

homesick alien,

you have come so far.
