One of the biggest clues that revealed to me my transmasculine-ness is an obsessive fear of giving out of consent.

If the fundamental role of the masculine is to give (at the physical level, quite literally through the penis), then the fear of the masculine is to give in a way that creates suffering -- forcing something onto someone that they don't want.

This is probably one of my primary fears: violating someone unknowingly, creating suffering or disconnection, and not being given the opportunity to re-establish the connection or take care of the aftermath.

I want to draw attention to how this fear reveals a psychological aspect of gender which has nothing to do with how I look or what I wear.

I believe that gender plays a big role in someone's psychological progression. And not having the correct framing for my gender identity has led me to spending a lot of time in confusion -- receiving support and guidance that did not feel relevant to me.

When I was a teenager I struggled a lot with aggression. In retrospect it's a pretty normal thing for a teenage boy. If I was male assigned at birth I would have been encouraged to try out for sports or otherwise channel my energy in a productive way.

Being socialized as a girl, most of the aggression got turned inwards. I became inwardly intense while outwardly quiet. People perceived me as shy even though I actually felt like a deranged hulk on the inside.

One late night before coming out this year, I raged on the sidewalk after being dragged out of a party I was invited to -- because I couldn't get in touch with the friend that invited me. I was having a really bad week and this happened to be the last straw.

With zero inhibitions left in my body I screamed "I need a men's group!"

And just like that -- a friend that was holding space for me during this episode ended up creating a men's group and inviting me to it.

Honestly one of the best parts of coming out has been receiving the support of brotherhood. It's been really healing to be around other men, hear their struggles, and feel just how much it relates to my experience.

I still don't know how gender works -- but this is what feels true in my body.
