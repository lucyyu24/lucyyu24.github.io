"It's so nice to sit down," she says as she made her way to the park bench. And she sat there, as the sun set and rose and the leaves went from green to brown to gone to green again. A new wrinkle.

She lost herself in the trees, the laughter of children, taller day by day, dogs on leashes. The same people who sat on park benches, different people, people who never came back.

And so she wanted to take part in the play, to laugh and sip coffee and to have a child walk up to her. Hello mommy. What's that mommy?

But there were bills to pay, laundry to fold, running from store to store and the next thing you know it's already 1 a.m. and you wonder where the time went.

Wouldn't it be nice to sit down?
