It's the 14th day of December and I've been in a bit of a creative vacuum as of late.

Coming off of my November writing challenge I've struggled to find a rhythm and structure for channeling my creativity that holds me through the ebb and flow of life.

Increasingly I'm seeing life as a journey towards finding balance between spaciousness and structure, feminine and masculine polarities.

And I'm starting to get better at detecting when my life falls too much on one side or the other.

When I'm too much in my feminine without having much structure to hold me accountable, I start feeling aimless, depressed and would get lost in whatever drama life throws in front of me.

When I'm too much in my masculine without creating spaciousness, rest, and spontaneity, I start grinding myself to a bone while not being able happy with the work I'm doing or the way I'm treating others.

When I notice myself falling too far on one side of the polarity I start to resent it and whiplash the other way around.

Over the last week I was processing some deep emotions and, without much structure in my life at the moment, I sunk really deep into them.

Coming out of that depression I immediately wanted to "get to work" to avoid being in the same place again.

Yesterday I sat in front of my laptop for 4 hours trying to discipline myself into writing this long post that I was convinced will bring me catharsis and bring together all the disparate parts of my life.

Funny enough the post was going to be on balancing between the masculine & feminine, classical & romantic, mind & heart.

Instead of finishing the post in the way I envisioned -- with a sense of relief and accomplishment -- I found myself trying to squeeze blood from a stone.

The post felt dry and lifeless, causing me to abandon it altogether.

In the past the story would have ended there: another heartbreak, another "time wasted," another "why did I do this to myself".

Yet if I hadn't experienced this inner drama I wouldn't be writing this post right now.

In a way I couldn't finish the other post because this was the post that actually wanted to be written.

This was the real substance behind what it means to wrestle between the mind and the heart, the masculine and the feminine -- not the theory and anecdotes I was wafting through and trying to connect the dots from.

It's funny that our journeys are filled with paradoxes.

The more disciplined I am, the more surrendered I have to be towards the outcome.

The more fervent my heart is, the more intelligent I have to be to see through the intentions of my heart.

The more masculine I am, the more feminine I have to be in equal proportion so that I'm not running on empty.

Balance is the key to mastery.
