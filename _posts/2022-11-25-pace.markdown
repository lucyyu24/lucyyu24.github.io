<br />

In a world of accelerating change

Slowing down is soft rebellion

Sometimes we have to slow down to speed up

It’s all in the ripe and ruin

强扭的瓜不甜

You taught me that baby girl

You can’t shout at grass to make them grow

Patience patience

Sunlight, water makes the heart glow.

<br />

Some of us are bamboos

Five years underground before shooting up overnight

Others sprout soon after the seed plants

No need for faith in the invisible.

<br />

Go at your own pace.

Follow your inner rhythm.

No one can tell you what you know.
