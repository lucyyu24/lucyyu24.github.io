I'm kicking off a series of posts with the story behind each of the tracks in [Chartreuse Phoenix](https://zanny.net/blog/2022/12/31/chartreuse-phoenix.html).

This is track 1, it's called Ashes. You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4GSRJrLAxsARtJoonDNpL6?si=70b75dc9855a4076) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/ashes/1661683512?i=1661683513).

Right around when I write this song I had a violent dream in which I shot my sister: it cut to my deepest fear of hurting the people that I love the most.

I’ve felt abandoned and others have felt abandoned by me and I don’t think we do any of it consciously. Sometimes we’re so wrapped up in our own insecurities we don’t realize how we’ve neglected someone’s invitation for connection.

This song is about that type of heartbreak.

And in that tender holy place

why do we turn toward disgrace?

abandoned here, abandoned... everywhere

in the ashes over you.

<br />

And with your pale and trembling face

you kiss these scars you can’t erase

“What happened here?”

“You pulled the trigger my dear

and I’m still not over you...”
