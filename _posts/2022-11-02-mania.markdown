My mind speeds at 100 miles per hour on country roads and maybe it’s not that I should slow down but rather I should go start racing because what mania is is this rush of energy that affirms the truth of life and when that energy is not accepted by those around us it becomes medicalized, illegitimized, and when we bump into others on the road we make a big mess and they’re begging us to slow down so we hit the brakes become depressed instead of finding racetracks where our troubles become our gifts.

It’s all about context can’t you see? There are no absolutes in life only relationships and if you care enough you will find yourself in the right outlet where your energy serves humanity instead of plugging in a 220v into a 120v and blowing out the whole damn building.

If you saw me type this you would think I’m crazy, thought police don’t come after me, I’m just trying to do research for my blog post, there’s no limits to where my mind can go and that’s a good thing because how can you claim to be truly moral if you don’t have the imagination to consider all the possibilities?

My mania is my gift and I won’t let you tell me otherwise but I will stop to pause and think when it’s starting to hurt you or me and that’s when I know it’s time to move on to a different form of containing my energy.
