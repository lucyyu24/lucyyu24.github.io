Now for a lil poem. Enjoy:
<br />
<div align="center"> âˆž </div>
<br />

I love reflecting on the process of creating

because how we do one thing is how we do everything --

the macrocosm is reflected in the microcosm,

each moment a universe, Fibonacci.

So don't be embarrassed by your obsessions of the infinitesimal,

for the finite gives us maps to infinity.
<br />
<div align="center"> âˆž </div>
<br />

Problems of creativity are never problems of creativity --

we're always creating whether or not consciously, you see?

Rather it's an unwillingness to see the perfection of what is

so that one day it may turn into: what could be.
<br />
<div align="center"> âˆž </div>
<br />

I remember the moment when I fell in love with house music

when I was patient enough to sit through the repetition

and hear the resulting symphony --

it's the irritation that produces The Pearl,

boredom that leads to ecstasy.

<br />

Yet the name, I discovered, carried a double meaning,

after I named the track I held on instead of released --

"the mix isn't too good," my perfectionist pleads,

"if you polish it up it will sound better to me".

But what if it's not a good use of my energy

to polish the details when I could be

focusing on where my aliveness leads me?

<br />

What if Steinbeck knew the dangers of clinging,

and our treasures are meant to be shared,

not held on tightly?
