I rely a lot on my environment to reinforce my sense of self.

I get very nervous when I'm in a place where I don't feel seen.

But what if those situations were actually opportunities?

Because where there’s polarity, there’s contrast and the opportunity for me to show up more boldly, more courageously.

What if I bring it?

I bring myself wherever I go?

I bring so much of myself that no amount of dissonance or pressure to conform can hold me back, wash me out?
