And even though

perfectionism creates pain for me

It is not an illness,

nor useless suffering.

It is a loyalty â€”

devotion to the cause of all that is

true and beautiful,

and a striving

towards greater wisdom and knowledge

if only

I place him as my copilot

instead of letting him drive

so that I may arrive at

the destiny that is

meant

for me.
