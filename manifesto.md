The Australian Aborigine survived one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet while spending 3/4 of their lives elevating their consciousness through art: story, music, song, dance & painting.  

Art has always played a vital role in the survival of our species.

I believe we all came here to be artists, and it is both our responsibility and birthright to create the vision of reality contained within us.

My intention with this blog is to refine my truth while reflecting on what it means to be an artist: what is the journey about?, what is my responsibility?, and what is my vision of the future?
