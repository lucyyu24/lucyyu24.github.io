The Australian Aborigine survived one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet while spending 3/4 of their lives elevating their consciousness through art: story, music, song, dance & painting.  

Art has always played a vital role in the survival of our species.

My intention with this blog is to refine my truth while reflecting on my artistic process, responsibility, and view of the future.
