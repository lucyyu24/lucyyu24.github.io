The Australian Aborigine survived one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet while spending 3/4 of their lives elevating their consciousness through art: story, music, song, dance & painting.  

Art has always played a vital role in the survival of our species.

My intention with this blog is to refine my thinking around what it means to be an artist in the modern world: by reflecting on my process, the responsibility of the artist, and how can we use art as way-showing towards a more whole, spiritually connected and unified future.
