I'm afraid to show you my anger

because I'm worried that

if you don't receive it the right way

you will become defensive or afraid of me --

even though anger can be life-giving

like the time I was grateful

when someone cussed at me in traffic

after I almost merged lanes

without seeing them on my side.
