>Been growing a lot this pride month. Getting better at being in my body.

>For a long time my spirit just didn’t land in my body (😭 fucking sad, I know). Now I’m better at YES-ANDing, and I see all of life as one big multidimensional YES-AND puzzle.

>I have a masculine spirit AND I live in a feminine body. What new vision of self is wanting to emerge from that? How can I harmonize these seemingly contrasting aspects of my being?

>Questions to be answered not through words alone but through living.

>No longer seeking finality of form or identity, rather — committed to the process of continuous self-invention and re-invention. Committed to actively engaging with this life 🌿

>TLDR: All pronouns work 🏳️‍🌈😊🏳️‍🌈

>Happy pride month ⭐️

About a year ago I came out as trans.

Sorry if this comes as a shock to the friends I’ve made recently, I haven’t been talking about it much these days.

A year in, my experience of gender hasn’t changed much but the way I’m relating to it has.

Transitioning is a process of making changes in our lives to help us embody who we are.

Early on in my journey I realized I don’t want to take hormones because I like my body the way it is.

Instead I changed my name and pronouns and found the brotherhood I’ve always longed for, which has been incredibly healing.

I’m happy to say that I’m at a point where I’m cool with all pronouns.

I’m feeling more secure in my masculine and  leaning into living out a gender of my own invention, without identifying as a “dude dude” — which comes with its own set of baggage in this society.

I’m still grateful for having taken this first step to come out that gave me the scaffolding to build myself back up from a place of authenticity.


ϟ


Maybe my story is unusual because my transition is more metaphysical than physical, involving more inner shifts than outer shifts — so I’m sharing in case it resonates with you.

A friend said to me that figuring out gender stuff is about as hard as finding enlightenment so… 🤷 hang in there if you’re going through it right now.

It’s intense but so worth it.

My gender journey is far from over but I’m much more resourced now to invent and embody myself thanks to all of your support.

Excited to see what more unfolds in this next chapter beyond traditional labels or identities.
