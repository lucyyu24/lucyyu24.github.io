Back in February I had a crazy nightmare.

I was taking a nap mid-day and had this dream that I was stuck in a house party.

The lighting was fluorescent and harsh. The decor distasteful.

Worst of all, everyone was so nice.

They kept complimenting me and how excited they were to see me --- but the feeling was not mutual.

I faked smiles while wanting to jump out of my skin.

Everytime I announced my intention to leave someone would offer to escort me to the door and, I would follow them only to find myself in another room where I'm pulled into some other conversation or activity.

This must have happened 10 times before I finally woke up in cold sweat.

I find it funny that this nightmare captures some of my worst fears:
- Claustrophobia, being stuck in one place with no where to turn.
- Helplessness, loss of agency.
- Disappointing people that are really nice to me.

Unpacking that last one is gonna be a doozy.
