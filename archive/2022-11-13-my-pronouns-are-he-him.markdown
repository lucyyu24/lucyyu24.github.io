A couple of days ago I put out this post that talked about how in one of my worst nightmares I go to this house party where people are really nice to me and I'm uncomfortable.

Unpacking that further I realized the nightmare is really about people not seeing me.

Most of my life I presented as this Asian girl and was treated according to that image. There's a way in which people can be really nice to me but I don't feel seen.

When I first came out one of the first things an ex-lover said was: "but you're so feminine."

Yeah dude --- why don't we switch bodies and you can let me know how easy it is to be yourself.

I was never intentionally deceptive.

But I also knew that I would be more attractive to men if I presented the way I did.

I knew that it would be safer, and I would not be physically harmed.

I am a dude having the experience of being in a female body.

And what feels authentic to me is not always presenting precisely the way I feel

but acknowledging all the forces at play and considering how I want to play my hand.

For many years I felt like a con artist even before I had the full awareness that I was trans.

In retrospect I was just trying to live my life.

Whenever I dressed "feminine" it would be hyper-feminine --- because it was performative.

Being a woman was a weird drag I put on that made me dissociate from my body.

My friends always said "Lucy is so in her head all the time."

Haha no shit.

There are many ways to be trans and they're all valid.

It's not as straightforward as getting top surgery and taking testosterone. Physical transition is not the right solution for everybody.

Sometimes it makes life easier to present more feminine, sometimes you just want to full send guy mode.

There's no right answer --- only trade-offs.

All things considered I'm doing really fucking well

and I'm so optimistic about my future.

I'm glad I live in a time and place where my being is accepted.

I'm grateful to have the vocabulary to articulate my experiences.

And I'm hopeful that more of the right people will come into my life ---

the people that really see me.
