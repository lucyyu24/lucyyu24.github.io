They called me a bully

They said I was mean 

My anger was not received in kind

My rage unregistered as love.

“You’re so full of problems”

“Why are you like this”


<br />

When I was 11 I moved countries

received a new name my past erased

a punk became “Lucy”. 

“I wanted to be your girl more than I wanted to be myself.” 

And so I did.


——- 11 ——-


I can be angry. 

Fuck this world for making me forget who I am.

But I did it to myself.

I was scared to hurt you —

it’s scary to be me. 


<br />

Scared I was. And scared I will be. And with fear 

I will continue walking this journey.🤘
