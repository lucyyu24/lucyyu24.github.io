[(( Refresh I ))](https://zanny.net/blog/2022/11/03/refresh.html)

I spent the last month going inwards, incubating a new vision of self. A lot has been happening -- not all of which I'm ready to talk about, and I'm not sure when I'll emerge from my hermit-ing.

There's been new art, new music. It feels like I'm *just starting* to step into the self that I've been seeing, hearing, feeling for years.

Every stage of transformation is like the peeling back of a layer. The onion reveals its core that was integral to the whole all along. With each step I feel myself growing lighter, more simple, natural and without pretension. To me, that's the whole point of this journey.

It always starts with a color.

And then maybe a font too.

Finally in my hot pink era.
