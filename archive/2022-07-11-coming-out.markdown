A line of inquiry came to a resolve on July 8th, 2022 in the midst of a medicine journey. The question started from the moment I was born and ended on the day I was born again.

Very early on I resigned to the possibility of a ever being a man even though in retrospect, it was all that I had longed for. I remember saying, as early as 6 or 7 years old, that if I had a choice, I would love to be a boy. And since I donâ€™t, Iâ€™m happy being the gender Iâ€™m given.

Itâ€™s as if I took a look at the cards I was dealt and the path forward didnâ€™t seem to offer me a choice. Even when I came out as non-binary last year it didnâ€™t occur to me that I would feel safe admitting to being a man, even though deep down, I already knew who and what I am.

Fear is this really funny thing. When youâ€™re consumed by it it seems to be all-consuming. The moment you decide with all your being to step awayâ€¦ it crumbles like a house of cards.

When I look back on these images of my younger self â€” I see a beautiful being that stayed kind and true in the midst of so much confusion, so much depression, so much indescribable pain. Every mis-attuned touch, every misunderstood look, every interaction that erased the truth of who I am, I forgive now.  

Iâ€™m grateful for all the work paved by those before me and the beautiful loving community that Iâ€™m finding myself in now which allows for me to live out my deepest truths. I no longer need to hide.

All those years of being a woman is exactly what will make me a better man now. I have every desire to make this world as safe as possible for all feminine beings â€” and it is my duty to be of service to this cause.

This is the story of a princess with a vision of becoming a king. I hereby reclaim my kingdom.

My name is Zanny.

Itâ€™s nice to meet you.
