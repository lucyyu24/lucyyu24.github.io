There's basically 4 minutes left to today and I just started writing this blog post and I'm committed to writing one every day this month. 

As much as I hate deadlines, I find that so much of my best work is created under pressure. 

For a long time my goal in life was freedom -- I thought that if I had enough money and time and everything I need then I would be able to operate beyond survival and become more creative.

Now I'm realizing that creativity emerges from the pressures of survival.

When you don't have constraints everything is kind of loosey-goosey. 

When you have an abundance of time, money, resources at your disposal, then it doesn't matter as much what you do with all of that.

Life is beautiful because we don't have forever. 

I'm not gonna save all my best words for another day. If I have something to say I might as well say it now.

Because we're all gonna die -- can't you remember that?

Life is too damn short.

I want to make every moment count.
